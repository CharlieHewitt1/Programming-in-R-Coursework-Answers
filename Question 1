##Question1## 
# A vector is created, where the function rnorm creates 65 randomly chosen, and normally distributed values,
# and where the function trunc takes a single numeric argument and returns a numeric vector containing the
# integers formed by truncating the values towards 0.

##Preparation##
# *rnorm* and *trunc* create a vector of 65 random, normally distributed, truncated values. 
survey_values <- c(trunc(rnorm(65, sd=1, mean = 3.5 ))) survey_values

## Question 1 -Part A ## 
# The number of participants in the survey_values vector which agree with the question (elements >= 5) are counted.
# *sum* calculates the number of values in the survey_values vector that are >=5. 

agree_with_question <-sum(survey_values >= 5) 
agree_with_question

## Question 1 -Part B ## 
# A vector showing the positions of the participants in the survey_values vector that somehow disagree with the question (elements <= 3).
# *which* returns the positions of the values <= 3, in the survey_values vector. 

somehow_disagree <- c(which(survey_values <= 3))
somehow_disagree

## Question 1 -Part C ## 
# A loop which prints the value and position in the survey_values vector of each participant who did not disagree with the question
# (elements >= 4) is created.

# A for loop loops through the survey_values vector. 
# If the value >= 4, the value and its position in the vector are printed. 
# Each value and position is printed on a new line.

for (i in 1:length(survey_values)) {
  if (survey_values[i]>= 4) 
    cat("Value:", survey_values[i], "Position",i, "\n") 
}


# (Question 2 didn't require code - it involved identifying errors in a programme)
