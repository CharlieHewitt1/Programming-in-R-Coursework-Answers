## Question 3 ##
# Create an array of random values between 0-50, with dimensions of 12, 12, and 7.
# (representative of 12 points of data collection over 12 weeks, every day(7)) 

options(max.print=1000000)
rainfall <- array(c(runif(1008, min = 0, max = 50)), c(12, 12, 7)) 
rainfall

# Using the apply function, calculate the total rainfall during the week on each spatial cell. 
apply(rainfall, c(1,2), sum)

# Using the apply function, calculate the average amount of rainfall per day 
apply(rainfall, c(3), mean)
